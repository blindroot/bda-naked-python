=================

This buildout installs fresh and clean python 2.4 or 2.6 distributions on your
computer.

First bootstrap the buildout:
$ python bootstrap.py

If you want to use the distribute packaging system instead of setuptools type:
$ python bootstrap.py --distribute
For more information on this topic see: http://packages.python.org/distribute/

To install python 2.6 type:
$ ./bin/buildout -c buildout2.6.cfg

To install python 2.4 type:
$ ./bin/buildout -c buildout2.4.cfg

In both cases there will be a python executable with the name "python" in your
buildout's bin directory.

To install both python versions type:
$ ./bin/buildout
